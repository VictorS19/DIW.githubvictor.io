            <h1>Food for Thought</h1>

            <p class="texto">
                Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of
                your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.

                Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a
                permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.

                Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your
                activity level and calories.

                Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.

            <p class="texto">
                Use the following as a guideline:

                Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat
                Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas
                Fruit
                Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds
                Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in
                carbohydrates.

                When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh
                vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.
